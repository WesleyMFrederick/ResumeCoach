      - name: No Net Increase (NNI)
        additional_names:
          - NNI
          - Emissions Banking Program
        situation:
          - I was given the responsibility of converting the legacy NNI software applications and data to the modern permitting system.
          - The NNI Emissions Banking Program allows for the deposit of air pollutant emission reduction credits (ERCs). Companies can receive credits by introducing new emissions controls, such as upgrading or replacing old equipment, shutting down equipment, upgrading processes and materials, adopting stricter operating guidelines and adding control equipment to existing sources. These new controls must go beyond the requirements of current regulations and must be real, permanent, quantifiable, and enforceable.
          - Banked credits are permanent and can be used to offset emissions increases from new, permitted projects and traded or sold to other companies for their use.
          - Reductions of criteria pollutants can be banked.
        objectives:
          - Convert legacy Databank data into New Permitting/Production System (NPS) data schema.
          - Convert legacy Databank applications into new workflows for the New Production System.
        obstacles:
          -
        actions:
          - Interviewed subject matter experts (SME) on NNI workflows, goals, and objectives.
          - Reviewed written air quality programs, rules, regulations, policies, and procedures.
          - Analyzed legacy Databank data schema to identify gaps in existing system and workflows.
          - Developed and iterated on Power BI reports to create an interactive dashboard that could quickly identify, summarize, and provide details on the data used for the legacy Databank data schema.
          - Created NNI database schema for New Permitting/Production (NPS).
          - Worked with data team to implement new NNI database schema.
          - Recognized the risks associated with scarce SME and software development resources and prioritized the NNI roadmap accordingly.
          - Developed and iterated on Power BI reports to create an interactive report on New Permitting System, creating a backup method to access data in the case application and UI developers were not available to convert legacy applications and UI.
          - Led members of data and software development team to implement NPS versions of legacy Databank data and applications.
          - Organized efforts of Engineering SMEs to clarify and prioritize NPS versions of legacy Databank applications.
          - Used AI to increase the speed and accuracy of converting legacy database schemas into NPS SQL statements.
        results:
          - Reduced complexity of searching for data by reducing the number of data sources from 14 tables down to two.
          - Reduced the time needed to generate statistical summaries for aggregate, down from weeks to minutes.
          - Identified erroneous transactions that were out of compliance with BAAQMD rules, regulations, policies, and procedures.

      - name: Online Payment Portal
        additional_names:
          - Pay Any Invoice
          - Online Payments
        situation:
          - I was given the responsibility of upgrading the District payment system.
        objectives:
          - Reduce the cost BAAQMD paid for crediitt card service fees.
          - Switch customers from manual check and fax payments to online payments.
          - Reduce the cost of processing manual check payments
          - Reduce delays in issuing permits
          - Reduce cost of manually resolving invoice and payment related issues
        obstacles:
          - UI/UX for Online Payments
            - High friction to pay for an invoice online. Users needed to create an account before they could pay for an invoice online.
            - Lack of information presented to users when errors occurred. Prevented users from self servicing issues and increased calls and emails to District staff.
          - District culture of siloed divisions
            - Invoice and payment business process were owned by six (6) different divisions. This increased the complexity of analysis.
            - No single District employee owned invoice and payment processes. This increased the complexity and burden of stakeholder communications, alignment, and sign off.
            - Invoice and payment business process required hand offs between divisions, but division staff only had insight into and responsibility for their portion of the process. This increased difficulty of root-cause analysis and ownership of issues & bugs.
          - The technical systems used to generate invoices and process payments were fragmented
            - Ten (10) different invoice types were generated across 6 different systems. This increased the complexity of comprehensive analysis.
              - Three of the five (3 of 6) systems were legacy systems which had a lockdown on code changes. This constraint increased the complexity of implementing solutions using only modern systems.
              - The API between the modern invoice/payment system and the financial system was not capable of handling the high transaction volume. This would break application and payment transactions. A lack of diagnostic tools increased the difficulty of tracing transaciton errors.
            - Thirty (30) different payment scenarios existed. This increased the probability of errors, the difficulty of root-cause analysis and ownership of underlying issues, and identifying core needs and requirements.
          - The data for the majority of invoice types and monetary value was only available on a weekly schedule. This increased the complexity of presenting the current state of an invoice for online payment by end users.
          - Formally, my area of responsibility was upgrading the payment technology. However, to achieve the objectives, revising business process and influencing key stakeholders would be required.
        actions:

        additional_names:
          - NOV
          - Woodsmoke NOV Dashboard
        situation:
          - Notice of Violation (NOV) is the process for identifying, notifying, tracking, communicating, and prosecuting permit violations.
          - I was given the responsibility of solving for the Notice Of Violation business process being split across multiple systems. There was need to increase visibility of NOVs nearing their statute of limitations, or that had fallen through the cracks.
        objectives:
          - Reduce Total NOV Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR)
          - Reduce Legal NOV MTTR
          - Identify bottlenecks in NOV process
          - Increase collaboration and communication between Legal Division and Enforcement Division
        obstacles:
          - District culture of siloed divisions
            - The handoff of NOVs between Legal and Enforcement created 3 to 6 months of additional resolution time due to siloed communication and visibility.
            - The lack of a shared report between Legal and Enforcement resulted in competing priorities. This increased the MTTR and the chance NOVs would fall through the cracks, missing the 3 year window for resolution.
          - The technical systems used to generate to generate and track NOVs were fragmented
            - Two (2) different systems were used to track NOVs, resulting in confusion and duplication of NOV information.
            - A single view did not exist for the NOV business process. This resulted in additional MTTR due to confusion regarding which system to look for information.
          - The data for the legacy NOV data was only available on a weekly schedule in the new permitting system. This increased the complexity of presenting the current state of an NOV.
          - Formally, my area of responsibility was upgrading the NOV technology. However, to achieve the objectives, revising business process and influencing key stakeholders would be required.
        actions:
          - Met with District lead counsel and legal staff to define and align Legal's goals
          - Met with Legal staff to observe business process and document using User Story Mapping

          - Communicated findings of obstacles to stakeholders (Lead Counsel, Legal Staff, Enforcement Managers & Staff)
          - Developed and iterated Power BI reports to create interactive reports that could quickly aggregate, identify, and summarize all NOV transactions across disparate systems.
          - Estimated project scope, features, deliverables, and delivery dates
          - Facilitated meetings with the software development division to communicate needs and functional/technical requirements
