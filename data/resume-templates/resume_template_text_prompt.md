Create a resume template based on the following structure and guidelines:
- Use placeholders in [Title Case Bracketed Format]
- Maintain the same section headers: Summary, Experience, Achievements, Skills, Education
- Number placeholders where multiple can exist (e.g., [Job Title 1], [Job Title 2])
- Include 5 achievement/description bullets for each job experience
- Use "======" as section separators
- Maintain indentation for skills and achievements
- Provide instructional placeholders that guide the user on what to write

The template should serve as a comprehensive guide for creating a professional resume, with clear instructions for each section.
