# Product Context: ResumeCoach

## Why This Project Exists
ResumeCoach was created to address the significant challenge job seekers face when tailoring their resumes to specific job descriptions. Many qualified candidates fail to pass initial resume screens because they don't effectively highlight the most relevant aspects of their experience for each position. This tool empowers job seekers to present their qualifications in the most compelling way for each opportunity.

## Problems ResumeCoach Solves

1. **Resume-Job Alignment Gap**
   - Typical resumes use static content that doesn't adapt to specific job requirements
   - Candidates struggle to identify which aspects of their experience are most relevant
   - Manual resume customization is time-consuming and prone to oversight

2. **Qualification Optimization**
   - Job seekers often fail to emphasize experiences that directly address key job requirements
   - Important skills and accomplishments may be buried in generic descriptions
   - Candidates may not recognize the transferable value of their experience

3. **Time and Efficiency**
   - Customizing resumes for each application is labor-intensive
   - Without guidance, candidates spend hours rewriting with uncertain results
   - The pressure of application deadlines can lead to rushed, suboptimal customization
