# Plan for Updating Implementation Plan File

I'll update the `memory-bank/next-steps/naming-convention-implementation-plan.md` file to properly reflect the STYLE.md guidelines while keeping its functionality as a planning document. Here's my detailed approach:

## 1. Files to Leave Unchanged
- `naming-convention-catalog.md` - This is a historical record documenting the "before and after" of file/directory renaming
- `naming-convention-todo-list.md` - This tracks implementation progress with checked/unchecked tasks

## 2. Changes to Implementation Plan Document
For `naming-convention-implementation-plan.md`, I'll make the following changes:

### Keep As-Is:
- Phase 1 & 2 sections (Preparation/Documentation and Directory/File Renaming)
- The actual content describing the changes needed

### Update Style:
The "Phase 3: Code Content Refactoring" section needs updates to properly reflect the style guide:

1. **Class naming examples**: 
   - Show actual implementation of lowercase hyphenated format with proper `-node` suffix
   - Example: `LoadJobDescription` → `load-job-description-node`

2. **Function naming examples**:
   - Update using proper verb-object pattern with hyphens
   - Example: `_clean_string_for_filename` → `clean-string-for-filename`

3. **Variable naming examples**:
   - Update all to lowercase hyphenated format
   - Ensure boolean variables properly use `is-` and `has-` prefixes
   - Example: `job_description` → `job-description`

These updates ensure the implementation plan itself follows the style guide it's trying to implement, serving as both documentation and an example of proper naming conventions.
