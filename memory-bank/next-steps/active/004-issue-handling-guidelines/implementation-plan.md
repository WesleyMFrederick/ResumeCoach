# Implementation Plan for Issue Handling Guidelines

## Overview
This project addresses a critical gap in the Next Steps Management System where there are no clear guidelines for when to pause and consult with the user when encountering problems or unexpected situations (like empty files). The goal is to establish clear "stop conditions" and issue handling protocols.

## Problem Statement
Currently, when encountering issues such as empty files referenced in plans or other unexpected situations, there's no explicit guidance on when to stop and consult with the user. This can lead to wasted effort or incorrect assumptions when proceeding despite problematic conditions.

## Proposed Solution
Add explicit issue handling guidelines to the README.md file that clearly define when to pause and consult with the user, particularly for common issues like empty or missing files.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Review and Assessment
1. Review the existing Next Steps Management System documentation
   - `memory-bank/next-steps/README.md`
   - `memory-bank/.clinerules` (Next Steps section)
2. Identify optimal places to add issue handling guidelines

### Phase 2: Documentation Update
1. Update `memory-bank/next-steps/README.md` to include:
   - New section on "Issue Handling Protocol"
   - Clear definition of "stop conditions" that require user consultation
   - Specific examples of common issues (e.g., empty files, missing references)
   - Guidelines for communicating issues to the user

2. Update `memory-bank/.clinerules` to include:
   - Reference to the issue handling guidelines
   - Reinforcement of when to pause and consult

### Phase 3: Testing and Verification
1. Review the updated documentation for clarity and completeness
2. Verify that the guidelines are explicit and unambiguous
3. Update the Next Steps Management System documentation reference

## Success Criteria
- Clear guidelines added to README.md about when to pause and consult
- Explicit "stop conditions" defined in the documentation
- Examples of common issues that require user consultation
- Updated .clinerules reflecting the issue handling protocol
