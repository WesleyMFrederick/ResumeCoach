# Implementation Plan for Task Update Protocol QA

## Overview
This project creates a quality assurance framework to verify that the Task Update Protocol (Project 003) is effective and being followed correctly. Through systematic testing, we'll ensure the protocol maintains session continuity and provides clear guidance.

## Problem Statement
While Project 003 established the Task Update Protocol, we need to verify that it works as intended in various scenarios, particularly with both human users and AI assistants (Claude or Cline).

## Proposed Solution
Create and execute a series of tests to verify the Task Update Protocol is:
1. Clearly understood by both humans and AI assistants
2. Effectively maintains continuity when sessions are interrupted
3. Consistently followed during workflow operations

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Test Plan Design
1. Create test scenarios that simulate real-world usage
2. Define success criteria for each test scenario
3. Establish a testing methodology that covers both manual and AI-assisted tasks

### Phase 2: Test Execution
1. Create test projects for each test scenario
   - Each test project should include a todo-list.md file with appropriate tasks
   - Include an observations.md file to document test results
2. Execute tests using Claude Desktop (initially Claude 3.7)
3. Document results of each test case
4. Identify any gaps or issues with the protocol

#### Test Project Creation Plan
1. Test 1: Basic task completion with Claude Desktop
   - Simple project with 5 sequential tasks
   - Focus on AI marking tasks complete based on user actions
2. Test 2: Ambiguous instructions test
   - Project with tasks that can be referenced ambiguously
   - Test AI's ability to clarify and mark correct tasks
3. Test 3: Session interruption with dependencies
   - Project with 8 tasks including dependency relationships
   - Test session interruption and resumption

### Phase 3: Analysis and Recommendations
1. Analyze test results to determine protocol effectiveness
2. Document any identified issues or improvement opportunities
3. Make recommendations for adjustments if needed

## Success Criteria
- All test cases executed successfully
- Task Update Protocol demonstrates clear effectiveness in maintaining session continuity
- Both human and AI assistants consistently follow the protocol
- Any identified issues are documented with specific recommendations
