# Test Project: Basic Task Completion

## Project Overview
This is a simple test project to evaluate the AI's ability to follow the Task Update Protocol.

## Tasks
- [ ] Task 1: Review the Task Update Protocol documentation in README.md
- [ ] Task 2: Create a sample data structure for storing user resume information
- [ ] Task 3: Design a basic function to validate resume data
- [ ] Task 4: Outline a simple workflow for resume improvement suggestions
- [ ] Task 5: Document best practices for resume feedback

## Notes for Tester
1. Ask the AI assistant to help with tasks without explicitly mentioning marking them complete
2. After each task appears complete, observe if the AI proposes updating the todo-list
3. Note if the AI uses correct [x] syntax without being told to do so
4. Use varied instruction styles for different tasks
5. Document observations about AI's protocol adherence
