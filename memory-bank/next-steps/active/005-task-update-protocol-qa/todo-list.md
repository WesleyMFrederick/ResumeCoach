# Task Update Protocol QA To-Do List

## Test Plan Design
- [x] Define test scenario: Human user task completion
- [x] Define test scenario: AI assistant task completion
- [x] Define test scenario: Interrupted session continuity 
- [x] Define test scenario: Multi-task sequence with dependencies
- [x] Establish success criteria for each test scenario

### Test Scenario 1: AI Task Marking in Response to User Actions
**Objective:** Verify that AI correctly marks tasks complete when instructed by user actions

**Setup:**
- Create a test project with 5 sequential tasks in todo-list.md
- Craft specific user prompts that should trigger AI task completion

**Test Steps:**
1. User asks AI to help with a specific task (without explicitly mentioning marking it complete)
2. Once completed, observe if AI automatically proposes updating todo-list.md
3. Verify AI uses correct [x] syntax without being explicitly told to do so
4. Repeat for remaining tasks with varied instruction styles

**Success Criteria:**
- AI recognizes task completion based on user interactions
- AI proactively proposes marking tasks complete with [x] syntax
- AI updates todo-list.md before proceeding to next task without being prompted
- AI explains the importance of keeping the todo-list updated

### Test Scenario 2: AI Response to Ambiguous User Instructions
**Objective:** Verify AI follows Task Update Protocol even with unclear user instructions

**Setup:**
- Create a test project with 5 sequential tasks in todo-list.md
- Prepare intentionally vague user instructions

**Test Steps:**
1. User gives ambiguous instructions like "I think we're done with the first part"
2. Observe if AI clarifies which specific task was completed
3. Check if AI proposes updating todo-list.md despite vague instructions
4. Test with progressively more ambiguous instructions

**Success Criteria:**
- AI seeks clarification on which specific task was completed
- AI still proposes marking tasks complete with proper [x] syntax
- AI maintains todo-list.md accuracy despite unclear user communication
- AI educates user about the protocol's importance when appropriate

### Test Scenario 3: Interrupted Session with Dependencies
**Objective:** Verify AI maintains continuity across sessions and handles task dependencies

**Setup:**
- Create a test project with 8 sequential tasks in todo-list.md
- Include dependency relationships between tasks (e.g., "Depends on Task 2")
- Plan deliberate session interruption

**Test Steps:**
1. User works with AI to complete first 3 tasks
2. AI should mark each task complete in todo-list.md
3. Include at least one dependency relationship in first 3 tasks
4. User abruptly ends session after task 3
5. New session starts with "Please continue where we left off"
6. User asks to work on a task with unmet dependencies
7. Observe AI's ability to identify dependencies and suggest correct sequence

**Success Criteria:**
- AI correctly identifies which tasks were previously completed
- AI accurately determines the next tasks to work on based on dependencies
- AI identifies and explains task dependencies to user
- AI prevents work on tasks with unmet dependencies
- AI suggests the correct sequence for task completion
- AI maintains accurate task status despite interruption and dependencies

## Test Execution
- [ ] Test #1: AI marks tasks complete in response to user actions
- [ ] Test #2: AI follows protocol despite ambiguous user instructions
- [ ] Test #3: Test session interruption with dependent tasks
- [ ] Document results and observations for each test

## Analysis and Recommendations
- [ ] Analyze test results and determine protocol effectiveness
- [ ] Identify any gaps or issues with the protocol
- [ ] Make recommendations for improvements if needed
- [ ] Document final conclusions
