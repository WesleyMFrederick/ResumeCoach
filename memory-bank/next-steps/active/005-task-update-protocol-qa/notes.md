# Task Update Protocol QA - Notes & Future Considerations

## Testing Tools
- **Current Focus:** Claude Desktop with MCP (Claude 3.7)
- **Future Testing Needed:** 
  - Cline with VS Code
  - Claude 3.5 (non-reasoning)

## Model Differences
- **Claude 3.7 (Reasoning):** Better at inferring task completion from context
- **Claude 3.5 (Implementation):** Likely needs more explicit instructions for task tracking

## Future Test Variations
- Create Cline-specific test scenarios
- Test performance differences between models
- Test with multiple AI assistants collaborating on the same project

## Integration with Other Projects
- Consider integration with Project 004 (Issue Handling Guidelines) once unpaused
- Evaluate protocol across different project types beyond todo-list management

## Review Instructions
**IMPORTANT:** Review these notes at the completion of Test #1 to determine scope for Tests #2 and #3

## Questions to Address in Future
1. Does the protocol need to be adjusted for different tools?
2. Are there significant differences in how different models implement the protocol?
3. What additional guidance/documentation is needed for each environment?
4. How should the protocol adapt to more complex projects?
