# Clarification Plan for Idea Management System

## Creation Date
2025-03-15

## Purpose
This document outlines a comprehensive plan to clarify the functionality and workflow of the Idea Management System, specifically focusing on how the ideas and future directories should operate within the Next Steps Management System.

## Problem Statement
The current Idea Management System has established directories, templates, and transition checklists, but lacks clear guidance on:
1. How ideas should be named, stored, and tracked
2. The specific workflow from idea capture to implementation
3. Practical processes for transitioning between states
4. Integration with the Memory Bank system

## Proposed Solution

### Clear Idea Lifecycle Model
Define a 3-stage progression for ideas:
1. **Capture Stage** (ideas directory): Quick documentation of raw concepts
2. **Refinement Stage** (future directory): Structured development of implementation-ready concepts
3. **Implementation Stage** (active directory): Execution of well-defined projects

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: File Organization and Naming Convention
1. Create structured naming conventions:
   - Ideas: `idea-[descriptive-name].md` (no numbering to reduce overhead)
   - Future projects: `future-[descriptive-name].md` (no numbering)
   - Active projects: Continue with `NNN-[descriptive-name]` format

2. Update index tracking approach:
   - Add ideas section with simple bulleted list format:
     ```
     ## Ideas
     - [idea-descriptive-name] Brief one-line summary (Captured: YYYY-MM-DD)
     ```
   - Add future projects section with similar format:
     ```
     ## Future Projects
     - [future-descriptive-name] Brief one-line summary (Refined: YYYY-MM-DD)
     ```

#### Phase 2: Process Documentation
1. Create `idea-workflow.md` documenting:
   - Clear entry/exit criteria for each stage
   - Decision points for transitions
   - Responsibilities for maintaining documentation

2. Create a workflow diagram showing:
   - Idea progression path
   - Decision points
   - Documentation requirements at each stage

3. Update existing transition checklists with clearer guidance

#### Phase 3: Example Implementation
1. Create a sample idea using the template
2. Document the refinement process
3. Show a complete example transition from idea → future → active

#### Phase 4: Integration with Memory Bank
1. Update `.clinerules` to reference the Idea Management System
2. Ensure consistency with Memory Bank as source of truth
3. Document how idea tracking integrates with project planning

## Documentation Changes
1. Update `README.md` with new sections:
   - "Idea Lifecycle" with clear stage descriptions
   - "Practical Usage Guide" with step-by-step examples
   - Visual workflow diagram

2. Create `idea-workflow.md` as the definitive guide

3. Update transition checklists with more specific guidance

## Example Workflow
To illustrate the process, we'll document:
1. Capturing a sample idea: "Resume Template Customization"
2. Refining it into a future project
3. Transitioning it to an active project

This end-to-end example will demonstrate all stages and documentation requirements.

## Success Criteria
The clarification will be successful when:
1. The user understands when and how to use each component
2. The workflow from idea → future → active is unambiguous
3. All documentation reflects the clarified processes
4. A sample idea can be successfully moved through all stages

## Potential Future Enhancements
- Idea classification system
- Priority indicators for future projects
- Automatic transition documentation generator
- Integration with issue tracking or kanban boards
