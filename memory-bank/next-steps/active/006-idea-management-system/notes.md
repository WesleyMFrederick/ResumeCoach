# Idea Management System - Notes & Future Considerations

## Integration Possibilities
- Consider future integration with prioritization framework (proposed as separate idea)
- Potential integration with Jobs to be Done framework (proposed as separate idea)

## Scaling Concerns
- Monitor size and manageability of next-steps-index.md
- Consider splitting into separate indices if it becomes unwieldy
- Potential automation for idea management workflows

## Key Design Decisions
- Selected unified index approach instead of separate indices (for now)
- Added explicit "Future Considerations/Risks" section to template
- Emphasized emotional job (anxiety relief) in documentation

## Metrics to Consider
- Number of ideas captured
- Ratio of ideas that progress to future projects
- Ratio of future projects that become active projects
- Time from idea capture to implementation
