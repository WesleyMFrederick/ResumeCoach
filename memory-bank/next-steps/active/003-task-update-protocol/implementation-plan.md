# Implementation Plan for Task Update Protocol

## Overview
This project addresses a critical issue identified in the Next Steps Management System where todo-list.md files are not consistently updated immediately after task completion. The goal is to add clear directives to the documentation to ensure timely updates of task status.

## Problem Statement
Currently, there is no explicit requirement to update the todo-list.md file immediately after completing a task. This can lead to discrepancies between the actual project state and the documented state, making it difficult to track progress accurately.

## Proposed Solution
Add explicit directives to the README.md file and potentially the .clinerules file to emphasize the importance of updating todo-list.md files immediately after task completion.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Review and Assessment
1. Review the existing Next Steps Management System documentation
   - `memory-bank/next-steps/README.md`
   - `memory-bank/.clinerules` (Next Steps section)
2. Identify optimal places to add the task update protocol directives

### Phase 2: Documentation Update
1. Update `memory-bank/next-steps/README.md` to include:
   - Clear directive about immediate todo-list updates after task completion
   - Explanation of why this is important for project tracking
   - Example of proper task update workflow

2. Update `memory-bank/.clinerules` to include:
   - Reference to the task update protocol
   - Reinforcement of the immediate update requirement

### Phase 3: Testing and Verification
1. Review the updated documentation for clarity and completeness
2. Verify that the directives are explicit and unambiguous
3. Update the Next Steps Management System documentation reference

## Success Criteria
- Clear directives added to README.md about immediate todo-list updates
- Documentation wording that emphasizes the importance of this practice
- Updated .clinerules reflecting the task update protocol
