# Implementation Plan for Naming Convention Refactoring

After analyzing the ResumeCoach codebase and considering Python's import system limitations, we're revising our approach to maintain underscore naming conventions throughout the codebase.

## Phase 1: Preparation and Documentation

1. **Create a refactoring branch** - Work in a separate branch to avoid disrupting the main codebase ✓
2. **Document current state** - Catalog all files, classes, functions, and variables ✓
3. **Set up test cases** - Ensure we have ways to verify functionality after refactoring ✓
4. **Update STYLE.md** - Revise to specify underscore naming convention

## Phase 2: Directory and File Verification

1. **Verify directory naming**:
   - Ensure all directories follow underscore convention
   - Identify any directories using hyphens that need renaming
   - Most directories like `data/job_descriptions` already follow correct convention

2. **Verify Python file naming**:
   - Most Python files already follow underscore convention
   - Identify any files using hyphens that need renaming
   - Ensure consistent naming across the codebase

## Phase 3: Code Content Standardization

1. **Class naming standardization**:
   - Use lowercase underscore format: `load_job_description_node`
   - Standardize node naming with appropriate suffixes

2. **Function naming standardization**:
   - Ensure underscore convention: `clean_string_for_filename`
   - Methods like `prep`, `exec`, `post`, `exec_fallback` remain as is

3. **Variable naming standardization**:
   - Maintain underscore convention: `job_description`, `job_description_file`
   - Boolean variables use appropriate prefixes: `is_valid`, `has_metadata`

4. **Update any non-compliant references**:
   - Ensure all references follow the underscore convention
   - Maintain compatible imports throughout the codebase

## Phase 4: Testing and Validation

1. **Run unit tests** if available
2. **Manual testing** of key workflows:
   - Job description analysis
   - Resume generation
   - Any other core features

## Phase 5: Update Path References in Output Code

1. **Update file path generation code** to use new directory and file names:
   - References to `data/job_descriptions/`
   - References to `data/description_analyses/`
   - Other path references in the codebase

## Phase 6: Documentation

1. **Update any documentation** that references files, classes, or methods by name
2. **Create migration notes** for other developers

## Implementation Strategy

To minimize disruption, I recommend:

1. **Small, focused commits** - Group related changes (e.g., directory renames, then file renames)
2. **Regular testing** - Test after each significant change
3. **Coordinate with team** - Ensure everyone knows when these changes are happening
