# Implementation Plan for Memory Bank Update

## Overview
This project will integrate the Next Steps Management System with Cline's Memory Bank files, ensuring consistency and continuity across all project tracking systems.

## Phase 1: Understand Context and System Architecture
1. Read Cline's custom instructions from `docs/cline/memory_bank_custom_instructions.md`
  - Update the `memory-bank/next-steps/paused/002-memory-bank-integration/todo-list.md`
2. Present to the user your understanding of how Cline's Memory Bank works before proceeding
  - Update the `memory-bank/next-steps/paused/002-memory-bank-integration/todo-list.md`
3. Read the Next Steps Management System files:
  - `memory-bank/next-steps/README.md`
  - `memory-bank/next-steps/next-steps-index.md`
  - `memory-bank/next-steps/template.md`
  - `memory-bank/next-steps/transition`
  - `memory-bank/next-steps/completed/000-organizing-next-steps`
4. Update the `memory-bank/next-steps/paused/002-memory-bank-integration/todo-list.md`
5. Present to the user your understanding of how the Next Steps Management System works before proceeding
  - Update the `memory-bank/next-steps/paused/002-memory-bank-integration/todo-list.md`
6. Read all of Cline's `memory-bank` files:
  - `memory-bank/.clinerules`
  - `memory-bank/activeContext.md`
  - `memory-bank/productContext.md`
  - `memory-bank/progress.md`
  - `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`
  - `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`
  - `memory-bank/techContext.md`
7. Update the `memory-bank/next-steps/paused/002-memory-bank-integration/todo-list.md`
8. Present to the user your understanding of how Cline's Memory Bank files work with Cline's custom instructions before proceeding
  - Update the `memory-bank/next-steps/paused/002-memory-bank-integration/todo-list.md`
9. Confirm with user the goals, objectives, problems, constraints, and proposed solition
  - Update the `memory-bank/next-steps/paused/002-memory-bank-integration/todo-list.md`

## Phase 2: Draft Plan to Integrate Next Steps Management System with Cline's Memory Bank files
1. Think through the steps needed to integrate Integrate Next Steps Management System with Cline's Memory Bank files
  - **IMPORTANT**
    - Cline's Memory Bank files are the source of truth
    - Solutions should explore how Next Steps Management System can work alongside Cline's Memory Bank
    - Changes to Cline's Memory Bank files should be minimal to non-existant
      - **EXCEPTION** - `memory-bank/.clinerules`
        - Almost all proposed integration should go in .clinerules
2. Update the `memory-bank/next-steps/paused/002-memory-bank-integration/todo-list.md`
3. Propose a plan to the user. Wait for user feedback before proceeding.
